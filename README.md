sprint 4 notes: error from sprint 3 had progress made with showing the full job listing but not enough to fix entirely due to time. also md files are correctly created but issue when transfering them into pdf with the text going off the page and skipping to the next line which I was not able to fix. besides thoose 2 errors project is fully working

Sprint 3 notes:  GUI is almost fully function beside one formatting error I wasn't able to figure out where the entire listing is posted the GUI is able to display it but not in the correct way. 
besides that all tests work and pass the test cases
