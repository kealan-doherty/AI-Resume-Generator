reason why I choose my LLM/AI model : after expiriting with a the models in this class and another one COMP 399 ( Foundations of Mordern AI ). I ultimately settled with the google AI due to its easy of use in setting up in PyCharm and generally 
and over all liking the way the model operates. Compared to the other model options provided to us for this Sprint. 

For my prompt to generate the resume I first started simple with "resume in markdown format" to ensure it would be created and inputed into the text file correctly, afterwards I then prompted it for a sample resume based on someone trying to get hired 
for the role of junior software engineer to which it modified the resume according then finally I loaded in the json job data and asked it to base the resume off of the job data provided to it.
