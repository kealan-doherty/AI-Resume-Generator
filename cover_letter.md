Dear Rover.com Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Software Engineer position at Rover.com, as advertised on LinkedIn. Having followed Rover's mission to connect pet parents with trusted caregivers for some time, I am deeply impressed by your commitment to both pet welfare and fostering a positive, inclusive work environment. The opportunity to contribute to a company that values both technological innovation and the well-being of animals is particularly appealing to me.

The Search Experience team's focus on improving the pet parent experience resonates strongly with my passion for building customer-centric products. I am particularly drawn to the challenges of collecting the right data, guiding users to the best sitter matches, and ensuring clear communication between owners and providers. My experience in full-stack web application development, coupled with my passion for API design and observability, aligns well with the team's initiatives.

With over two years of professional software development experience, I am comfortable working across the entire system, from front-end to back-end. I have experience with Python and relational databases, and a strong understanding of automated testing, code quality, and engineering best practices. My project, an AI resume generator that leverages a database of job postings and Google AI to generate personalized resumes, demonstrates my ability to build innovative solutions from end to end. Furthermore, my meteorite data filtering project showcases my ability to manipulate and present data effectively.

I am eager to learn new technologies and contribute across the stack, as well as collaborate with product stakeholders to refine requirements and drive projects forward. I am confident that my skills and experience, combined with my genuine love for animals, would make me a valuable asset to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to learn more about this position and how I can contribute to Rover's continued success.

Sincerely,
Kealan Doherty
